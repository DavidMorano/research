Dave,

I would make the following changes to the paper:

1. While I like the title, I am not sure others will.  How about
something like: "Re-execution - An Approach to Simplify the Datapath in
Aggressive Out-of-Order Processors"

2. Pg. 1 - change course to coarse

3. Pg. 2 - ICCD is a design conference.  You do not stress design
complexity issues enough.  How does eliminate the ROB?  You allude
to this on page 6, but do not stress how ROBs limit scalability.
You need to discuss this in the intro to motivate the whole design.

How do we
implement the bussing structure?  Is the design scalable?  I think
we want to argue that this is a significant improvement in design
complexity compared to other machines, so we are enabling future
design that will have billions of transistors (the overriding
theme of the conference).

4. Pg. 8 - Why are the baseline results using on one decimal place,
and the rest of the IPCs using two places???

5. Pg. 8 - You put a lot of stuff in one Table.  It might have been
nice to have one graph as well (any room)?

6. Pg. 8 - Eliminate the term "proposed" in Table 2.  Use a better
label the doesn't suggest that this is just a paper design (we have
actually developed a model of it...)  It is okay to use the phrase
"our proposed design" in the text, but labeling with the word "proposed"
conveys a different message.

7. Pg. 7 - Correct the text "way clear way"

8. Pg. 6 - Why say that we do not have a clue about the number of
re-executions.  Of course there will be some changes due to various
dependencies.  So why do you report it?  Because it gets better.  Can
we just leave it at "and the number of re-executions is reduced..."
Saying anything more just digs a hole for you....

pg. 4 - In the caption for Figure 2 - "is shown" shoud be "are shown"

pg. 8 - Try to move Table 2 to appear earlier in the text.

This is all for now.

Dave

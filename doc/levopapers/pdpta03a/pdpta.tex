Predicated execution of instructions is known to reduce control-flow
complications due to conditional branches.
Currently, either software-only or explicit architected 
instruction predication (for those architectures that have it)
has been employed.
However, software-only predication is very limited in its ability to
eliminate conditional branches from the instruction stream and
only new processor architectures have substantial support for
explicit architected predication. 
We introduce a hardware scheme that allows all instructions
to be predicated dynamically at execution time within the
microarchitecture of the machine.  This allows for
both legacy instruction set architectures to benefit from
instruction predication as well as opening up possibilities
for more advanced fetching heuristics in new microarchitectures.
Further, this scheme is oriented towards application to
distributed microarchitectures, which is generally very different to
conventional microarchitectures with centralized hardware resources.

Our new instruction predication scheme builds on previous schemes
but avoids the complexity of older schemes.
It also is more suitable for application to a distributed microarchitecture
than some previous schemes.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{-0.15in}
%
Explicit architectural predication has been of particular interest for
several years now.  Explicit architectural predication is implemented
through architecturally visible predicate registers as part of
an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).  
Since these predicate
registers are part of the ISA definition, this type of 
predication can be thought of as a hardware approach to predication
as opposed to a purely software approach when no ISA predicate registers
are available.
Since the predicate registers are visibly part of the ISA of the machine,
the scheme has been referred to as {\it visible explicit predication}.
An example of a popular
ISA that uses architected (or visible explicit) hardware predication 
is the {\it iA 64} ~\cite{ia64}
ISA family of machines.
With architected predication, the compiler schedules instructions
(usually comparisons of some sort) to set the predicate
registers while other instructions are scheduled to be
dependent on those predicate registers as part of their execution.
In effect, instructions that are dependent on a predicate register
have the predicate register as an additional source operand to
the instruction.  
Of course, the goal is to
eliminate conditional branch instructions and replace them with
the use of instructions that both set (define) the predicate registers and
instructions that use those predicate registers.

One hardware alternative to architected predication 
is to not
have any predicate registers defined in the ISA to start with
while still providing predication of instructions at the microarchitectural
level of the machine.
This sort of predication strategy can be thought of as being 
invisible predication since
there are no predicate registers in the ISA.  
Rather it
is performed dynamically at program execution and is
referred to as simply {\it dynamic predication}.
One obvious advantage to this predication strategy is that it
can be applied to existing ISAs that never planned on using
any predication of any sort when they were first designed.  

Full microarchitectural based instruction predication
is a new way to manage control dependencies that avoids added
complexity for recognizing special control-flow construct.
With full microarchitectural predication
all conditional branches may execute concurrently 
and code that lies
between the branch and its target instruction (the {\it domain} of the
branch ~\cite{Uht91}),
for those conditional branch constructs with a join,
is now predicated and can be executed speculatively without additional
special
microarchitecture state that needs to be maintained for it.
Code that
lies beyond the joins of conditional branches is properly identified
as such (being control-independent of the branch)
and can be taken advantage of more easily (less hardware
complexity) than other approaches
such as that described by Cher et al ~\cite{Cher01}.

We are proposing a new hardware predication scheme that allows multiple
branches to execute concurrently and in an out-of-order fashion, while
also guaranteeing that each instruction obtains its correct predicate
value.
The new scheme presented is simpler than all previously known
schemes but retains the feature of not requiring any centralized
processor resources as well as being entirely 
suitable to a distributed microarchitecture.

\section{Background}
\vspace{-0.15in}
%
Several dynamic predication schemes are possible.
An early scheme was described by Uht et al ~\cite{Uht01}.
That scheme provides a
mechanism for predicating all instructions within
the microarchitecture of a computer, invisible to a programmer or
a compiler.
All instructions in flight within the
machine is
predicated regardless of the number and variation of control-flow-change
instructions that may be present.
This is accomplished by calculating control-flow 
dependencies for predicates associated with each instruction
and the initial values of those predicates at
instruction dispatch time (when decoded instructions are transfered
from the i-fetch buffers to instruction issue slots).
This scheme requires the
presence of a {\it Branch Tracking Buffer} that is used to correlate branch
target instructions with the original branch instructions that lead to
them.  
Unfortunately, the hardware needed to implement the tracking buffer
in order to search it for many dispatched instructions simultaneously
is very costly and does not scale well as the number of instructions
dispatched in a single clock grows.
Further, the presence of a centralized tracking buffer introduces
signal routing and timing problems for large distributed microarchitectures.

Other dynamic predication schemes have been 
introduced ~\cite{Morano02,uht02levo}
that have eliminated the need for any centralized tracking buffer.
These newer schemes dynamically discover the control-flow dependencies
among instructions as they are in flight after instruction dispatch.
These newer schemes are especially suited to distributed microarchitectures
since they discovery inter-instruction control-flow dependencies
in a distributed way.

The proposed scheme is oriented towards application on a distributed
microarchitecture ~\cite{Uht01,uht02levo} that uses time-tags for
dependency ordering of instructions and operands ~\cite{Kaeli01}.
Time-tags are small integers that provide and maintain the 
program order relationship among both instructions and operands.
Successive instructions are assigned successive time-tag values
and all operands that originate from an instructions are tagged
with the time-tag value that was assigned to the instruction.
The instruction that is next to commit among all in-flight instructions
is assigned the lowest value (generally zero) and the most speculative
instruction will have the highest value.

Further, in those distributed microarchitectures that we are targeting,
the instruction issue window is likewise spatially distributed in
silicon having each issue slot potentially separated from the others.
Also, instructions stay in their issues slots that they were dispatched
to until either retirement, being either commitment or abandonment (squash).
Communication paths (buses) are available to propagate result operands 
(along with other associated information like its time-tag value) from
one instruction to the next.

\section{Dynamic Hardware Predication}
\label{sec:hwpred}
\vspace{-0.15in}
%
A principal requirement of the scheme is to generate
predicates as instruction execution proceeds.
Each instruction computes
its own enabling predicate using predicate values 
that are forwarded to it by earlier instructions from the
program-ordered past.

\epsfig{file=brdomain.eps,width=3.0in} \caption{Branch Domains and
Closest Enabled Previous Branch.(CEPB)} \label{fig:brdomain}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:brdomain} shows a program code sequence with two
branches $b_1$ and $b_2$ and their corresponding targets $t_1$ and
$t_2$. The two branches divide the code into 4 basic blocks regions.
We are proposing a new scheme for
assigning an enabling predicate to every instruction in each
region based on the outcome of branches.  If the enabling
predicate value is one, then the instruction will be executed;
otherwise it is disabled.  The following definitions are used in
the description of our scheme.

%\begin{description}[\setlabelwidth{CEPB(Ij)xxx}]
\begin{description}{\setlength{\labelwidth}{3.0in}}
\item[$T_b$:] a binary value, set to one if the branch $b$ is predicted taken
\item[$en_j$:] a binary value assigned to each
instruction $I_j$ and specifies whether the instruction is
enabled for execution
\item[$D_b(I_j)$:] a binary value,
set to one if the instructions $I_j$ is in the domain of branch $b$.
\item[$CEPB(I_j)$:] Closest Enabled Previous Branch to instruction
$I_j$ in the static program-order.
\end{description}

In Figure~\ref{fig:brdomain} we have also shown the value of CEPB and $D_b$ variables
for the two branches in the figure.
The $D_b(I)$ function is
independent of the outcome of the branch and only depends on the
static order of the instructions in the code.  $CEPB(I)$, on the other
hand, is a function of the outcome of other branches and its value can
change during the course of speculative execution.

Using the above definitions, we can show that:
\begin{equation}
\overline{en_j} = T_b \cdot D_b(I_j)  \textstyle{\ where\ } b = CEPB(I_j)
\label{eq:preden}
\end{equation}

This equation simply tells us that if an instruction $I_j$ is in
the domain of an enabled branch, and if the branch is taken, $I_j$ will
not be executed.  If the instruction is out of the domain of its closet
enabled previous branch, then its execution is independent of the
outcome of the branch.

Equation~\ref{eq:preden} is the basis for our dynamic predication scheme.

To assign a predicate value to each instruction $I_j$, it is sufficient
to find the $CEPB(I_j)$ branch and its outcome.  This is a simple
task in our scheme.  Each active station has a pair of
registers to keep the time-tag of its current $CEPB$ branch and
branch target.

If an earlier branch is enabled, a transaction is sent on the
forwarding bus with the branch time-tag, its target address and whether
it is a taken branch or not. Each subsequent active station that snoops
this transaction checks to see if the time-tag of the newly enabled
branch is greater than the time-tag of its current CEPB branch.  If the
time-tag of the new branch is greater, the new branch must be closer to
this instruction, and therefore it will replace the older $CEPB$
branch.

If a branch $b$ becomes disabled, the later instructions need to find
another branch to act as their new $CEPB$ branch.  This new branch is
simply $CEPB(b)$, because according to the definition there is no other
enabled branch between $CEPB(b)$ and $b$. In our scheme this is
achieved  by initiating an invalidate transaction at branch $b$. An
invalidate transaction contains the time-tag of $b$, the time-tag of
$CEPB(b)$ and the branch domain information of $CEPB(b)$.  This
information was snooped by $b$ when $CEPB(b)$ forwarded its predicate.

To find the domain of a $CEPB$ branch, a simple approach is to just
compare the branch target address with the instruction address.
It is however more efficient to use time-tags for this purpose.
A branch only needs to forward the time-tag of its target
instruction instead of its target address. The branch target
time-tag can be easily calculated by adding the branch
displacement to the branch time-tag value.

Another improvement to the above scheme can be made by observing
that a not-taken enabled branch does not need to send out any
transaction on the forwarding bus.  This is due to the fact that a
not taken branch essentially acts like a NOP operation.  We can take
advantage of this knowledge by reducing the number of transactions on the
communicating bus.

\epsfig{file=dynpred.eps,width=3.0in} \caption{Example illustrating
Dynamic Predication} \label{fig:dynpred}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:dynpred} shows an example of how our dynamic
predication work.  The first column in the table lists the relative
clock cycles.  The next three columns list the status of each
branch.  The "D", "T' and "NT" entries correspond to disabled,
taken and not-taken status, respectively.  The next two columns
list the status of instruction $I_k$.  The labels "E" and "D" stand for enabled
and disabled status, respectively.  The $CEPB$ column shows the
$CEPB(I_k)$ branch at any cycle.  The next two columns show the
transactions on the bus.  The "PredVal" column lists the predicate
forwarding transactions for each branch along with its status.  The
"PredInv" column lists the invalidating transactions.  the branch
name in the parenthesis corresponds to the new $CEPB$ forwarded by
the invalidated branch.

In the example, it is assumed that $b_1$ and $b_3$ are initially
predicted taken and not-taken respectively.  As a result,
instruction $I_k$’s predicate is enabled.  In the next
cycle, $b_1$ changes its direction to a
not-taken and sends a forwarding transaction on the bus
indicating this change.
This transaction will enable $b_2$ which is also predicted taken.
$b_2$ will send a predication transaction on the forwarding bus
which is snooped by $b_3$.  As a result, $b_3$ will be disabled in
cycle 3 and will send an invalidating transaction with $b_2$ as
its $CEPB$ branch.  instruction $I_k$ will see this transaction and
switch its $CEPB$ to $b_2$ and will be disabled.  The
second part of the table in figure~\ref{fig:dynpred} shows what
will happen if $b_1$ changes back to a taken status.  A new set of
transactions will follow that eventually enable $I_k$.

The cost of hardware predication is low and most of the extra state
only uses a few bits in the active station.  This hardware is the same
for all active stations in the machine.

\section{Fetch Heuristics}

A set of heuristics are developed to guide I-fetch and take
advantage of dynamic predication. In the case of forward branches,
we define two threshold values: \emph{near} and \emph{far}. We
then compare the branch domain size with the threshold values to
categorize a branch as \emph{near} (less than the near value),
\emph{moderate} (between near and far) or \emph{far} (greater than
the far value). Since the domain of a forward branch possessing a
near target is small and can be easily fit within the execution
window, the fetch unit will load the instructions following the
not-taken path of the branch, regardless of its prediction.
Fetching and loading instructions following the not-taken path of
a conditional branch will capture hammock-styled branch
constructs. Simple single-sided hammock branches generally have
near targets and so can be captured within the execution window.
Our dynamic predication scheme provides an efficient way for
handling hammock branches using dynamic predication.

For a conditional branch with a moderate-distance target (neither
near nor far), we use a confidence predictor similar to the one
described in~\cite{} to measure the accuracy of the branch
predictor. If the branch can be predicted with high confidence,
the instructions are fetched from the predicted path. If the
confidence predictor indicates low confidence in this branch,
fetch continues from the sequential instructions after the branch.
By fetching the domain of the branch, in case the branch is
mispredicted, there is no need to flush the execution window. The
dynamic predication scheme will change the input predicates of the
instructions within the domain of the branch (to become enabled)
according to the outcome of the branch and those instructions are
re-executed as necessary.

In case of a conditional branch with a far target, we will always
follow the predicted path to avoid loading a large number of useless
instructions into the execution window.

If a conditional backward branch is predicted taken, it will be treated
as a loop, and fetch/dispatch will follow the taken path of the branch.
This policy will basically unroll the loop and fill the execution
window with successive iterations of the loop.

\section{result}

We have measured the effect of choosing different values \emph{near}
and \emph{far} branch thresholds using a set of benchmarks form Spec95
and Spec2000.  Table~\ref{tab:rslt1} shows the harmonic mean of percent
speedup over all benchmarks.  In our base configuration instructions
are always fetched from predicted path.  The data in this table shows
that for a fixed \emph{far} threshold, as we increase the \emph{near}
threshold we get an increasing speedup.  For a near threshold value
greater than 16, the speedup starts to decrease.  The reason is that we
are fetching more and more branches from the fall-through path
regardless of their prediction.  As a result, the ratio of squashed
instruction to the fetched instructions is increasing and performance
is decreasing.

Another observation is that for a fixed near threshold value, by
increasing the far threshold, speedup decreases and in many cases we
actually see a slow down.  This means that using confidence predictor
to handle moderate branches does not perform as well as static
approach.  One explanation for this is that confidence predictors do
not consider the advantage of static fetching.  Predicating highly
predictable branches is still advantageous since it allows more
instructions to be fetched each cycle.  Our results show that using
confidence estimators is not necessary for dynamic predication.

Using predication we got an average speedup of 3.6\% over all
benchmarks using a value of 8 for both near and far threshold.  This is
equivalent to fetching along fall-through path of a branch with domain
size less than 8 and following the predicted path for all other
branches.

For each interval type that we have explored, the results
for the benchmarks are shown in two groups of five benchmarks each.
Access (read) intervals are shown first, followed by useful-lifetime
intervals, and finally the def-use intervals.

% RRINT
%
The data for register access-use intervals are
shown in Figures \ref{fig:aa_rrint} 
and \ref{fig:ab_rrint}.
Results from benchmark programs BZIP2, COMPRESS, CRAFTY, GCC, and GO
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:aa_rrint} while the results
from programs GZIP, IJPEG, MCF, PARSER, and VORTEX are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:ab_rrint}.

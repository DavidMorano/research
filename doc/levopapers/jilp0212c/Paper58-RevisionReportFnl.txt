The authors propose LEVO - a novel implementation of an out-of-order
microarchitecture that's scalable to very large instruction windows.

The LEVO "execution window" consists of a number of columns.  Each
column is a scheduler/execution unit cluster that can be cascaded to
create large scheduling windows.  A one-cycle latency is allocated for
communicating results between columns.

The authors propose the use of time tags which avoid the need for
register renaming, and the use of segmented busses as a good way to
address interconnect delays.

The paper's main contribution is in the area of scheduler/execution unit
design.  The LEVO execution window, columns, and active stations are
very novel.  I like how the authors propose to satisfy the the physical
constraints in building a large out-of-order machine.  LEVO is radically
different from the conventional multiple, distributed reservation
stations.

I had a lot of questions after reading this paper.  
Obtaining high IPC
requires the solution to numerous problems which the authors do not
explain in detail, but rather cite references.  
	--Space is an issue, as is the possibility of overwhelming
	the reader with details. We believe we have struck the right 
	balance, especially with the revisions made to the paper.
	--We have added more detail as requested via the reviewers'
	questions and comments.

The author's claim of
>10 IPC on gcc is not likely realizable because of instruction fetch
limitations.  
	- We would have to say that in the current machine this is true;
	we say this right up front, in the first paragraph of the
	Introduction. The point of saying this was to give an indication of
	the potential of the machine, as well as what it realizes 
	today. We think it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not
	gcc will ever realize IPC's of 10 or more; we remain optimistic.
	After all, what we do realize with the current instruction
	fetch unit was unthinkable just a little while ago.
	--We have made no changes for this comment.

How do the branch predictor and instruction fetch feed
LEVO? 
	--The discussion of this in Section 4.1 has been expanded.

How does LEVO determine which branches to predicate? 
	--All branches in the E-window are predicated. 
	--This has been clarified in the text. Also see the revisions
	for the previous question.

The data side
was also not addressed in detail: how do LEVO's speculative store
buffers work? 
	--We presume you mean the PCBs.
	--Clarified in text.

How does LEVO do store-load dependency checking?
	--Essentially, the same way register dependencies are enforced.
	--Discussion added in text.

The authors do not mention the downside of using time tags: wakeup
becomes slower since more bits need to be compared (time tag + logical
register ID versus physical register ID), and greater than/less than
compares are required (as opposed to equality comparisons).
	--The time tags are quite small (~8 bits), so the impact
	is slight.
	--We have added a comment on this to the text.

The paper doesn't talk about the processor's pipeline - can LEVO be
described as a pipeline and how many pipeline stages does it have? 
	--Levo cannot easily be described as a pipeline without
	obscuring its logical operation. Also, such a description
	could be misleading: each column could be thought of as a 
	pipeline stage, but this is clearly not the operational
	case or intention.
	Never-the-less, we have made an attempt to compare a classic
	pipelined processor with Levo elements; see the paragraph
	before Section 3.1.
	--Analogy added to text.

How
many clocks does it take to recover from a branch mispredict? 
	--It is not a single number, due to the overlapping operations
	in the E-window.
	--Discussion has been added to the text. 

The reader
could benefit from a comparison of LEVO against a conventional
out-of-order microarchitecture (with similar effective scheduler and ROB
sizes).
	--This is problematic, since estimating the cost of such a
	conventional processor is difficult and is way beyond the scope
	of this paper. We feel we have bounded whatever performance 
	such a machine would get by simulating Simplescalar with, 
	effectively, unlimited resources. Therefore, our comparison is
	conservative.
	--Some text has been added that expands on the Simplescalar
	comparison.

Because the paper covers a lot of ground, it tends to quickly go over
each idea.  I think the authors can improve the paper by narrowing their
scope and concentrating more on the key aspects of LEVO (scheduler and
execution).
	--While we certainly do see the reviewer's point, it is in
	fact very hard to do this without compromising some aspect
	of the discussion of the machine. E.g., if the floorplan and
	other realization information is left out, then we do not
	make our case for scalability of the architecture. We would
	also run the risk of overwhelming the reader with detail; we
	would prefer to give a "bigger picture" view of Levo in this
	paper.
	--No major changes have been made for this comment.

Section 2. BRIEF SUMMARY OF PAPER
Please provide a brief summary of the paper for the editors. 
Please avoid duplicating the abstract.

Levo is a segmented architecture where most processing and accesses
are performed locally within a unit called Sharing Group. Multiple
sharing groups are connected via fixed-length communication buses
to allow data-flow like computation. Data dependences are resolved using
time tags, while control dependences are resolved using predicate (and
cancellations). Disjoint Eager Execution (DEE) can be implemented
in a relatively straightforward manner. IPC of Levo in a realistic
implementation (realistic memory and I-fetch) is about 5 for most
application. (IPC for ijpeg is about 10 -- presumably, unrolling
transforms loop-level parallelism into ILP)

Section 3. COMMENTS TO AUTHORS
Please provide constructive criticism to the authors to help them improve 
their paper. Please also point out any flaws to justify your recommendation 
in Section 1.

Overall it's a very interesting idea. I have quite a few questions,
in no particular order, that I'd like to see clarified in the final version.

1. When committing a column and renaming existing ones, all the LSTT's
have to be updated accordingly, right? 
	--In the current scheme, yes. A revised scheme that does not
	necessitate this is presented
	in another paper under review elsewhere.
	--This has been clarified in the text.

Does that mean every AS has a 
dedicated simplified ALU to do "<=" time tag test and this LSTT 
recomputation?
	--The two functions are likely kept separate. Since the
	time tags are small, the hardware required for these functions
	is also small and fast. The update due
	to column shifting only requires decrementing about
	a 3-bit number (the column part of the time tag, for an 8-column
	machine). As mentioned above, this is eliminated with a new
	approach discussed in another paper. The "<=" comparison is only
	over about 8 bits. 
	--These issues have been clarified in the paper.

2. It seems that when an instruction is first fetched from the I-cache 
into an AS, it has to start execution immediately reading operands from
RFU. Is that so? 
	--This is approximately true.
	--Clarified in the text.

If so, this sounds like it will generate a lot of false
computation down stream. Comment? 
	--For later columns, this is so, but it does not significantly
	impact the performance of the machine.
	--Discussion added in the paper.

If not, what triggers an instruction
to execute? Notice that the producer instruction might have already finished
execution before the consumer is brought into the AS.
	--Since results are always propagated forward to later RFU's,
	and intervening instructions will re-execute as necessary,
	then either the RFU for the new column has the correct data,
	or the data is on its way.
	--Clarified in the text.

3. What is the size of PCB? 
	--The column size (n entries, the worst case for no overflow).
	--Clarified in the text.

Do you copy it to the new column as you
do the RFU? 
	--Logically, yes, physically, no; as discussed in the chip
	realization section, nothing is actually copied from column
	to column, the column number is just decremented.
	--Clarified in the text.

How to handle an overflow? 
	--An overflow is not possible, by construction (see above).
	--Clarified in the text.

What is the special provisions
for Load instructions in the AS? 
	--Clarified in the text.

Now, loads should be re-executed if
a there is a broadcast of address of prior store that matches or overlaps
its address. So you need a full 32-bit address that keeps the effective
address, not just the 5-bit register address for normal instruction
re-execution. 
	--Yes; clarified in the text.

When propagating stores down stream, do you carry domain
predicates? 
	--Domain predicate propagation is separate from memory store
	propagation, the two are not directly linked. We can't see 
	your implication here.
	--Partially clarified in the text.

Related question, when you backward request a load, do you 
just check MFU without trying to compare effective address with
earlier store instructions' address? (you mentioned request with
memory backwarding buses being satisfied by active stations.)
I think it's easier to just check
MFU, 
	--The latter is true.
	--Clarified in text.

so the question is, how many re-load happens on average? 
	--We do not follow your question. A load only re-requests
	data if one of its inputs has changed (calculated
	effective address), but we do not see how this relates to 
	your prior discussion.
	--No changes made to text.

Do you
actually plan to have Levo multiprocessor ready? 
	--We have begun to devise a Levo multiprocessor,
	and it may exhibit some neat characteristics, but its development
	is incomplete, and is beyond the scope of this paper. We
	are only concerned with Levo's uniprocessor aspects in this paper.
	--No changes made to text. (But thanks for asking.)

If so, any thoughts
on LD-LD replay trap?
	--To be honest, I'm not quite sure what you mean. However, the
	goal for the Levo multiprocessor is to sidestep traditional
	SMP issues, especially such nasties as cache coherence, and to
	minimize data dependencies throughout the machine. We are part-
	way, but not completely, there.
	--No change to text.

A Figure 3 for MFU is in order.
	--We have added a figure for the MFU.

4. In the DEE implementation, could you elaborate on the broadside loading
especially, if this is not in the same column. What is the hardware
requirement for this loading?
	--Clarified in text.

5. Minor questions:
since you use trace, how do you get wrong path instructions?
	--We were not complete in our description of the simulator.
	The simulator actually combines trace- and execution- driven
	features.
	--Clarified in text.

why would reorder buffer (not the simple scalar RUU) grow with O(k^2)?
	--Clarified in text.

why would a p-stage pipeline (not a p-wide one) grow with O(p^2)?
	--Clarified in text.

It's an interesting paper, I really want to see it published, but
I'd like to see a more comprehensive explanation. I'd rather see DEE,
the physical considerations and even some of the evaluation in a different
paper, to make space for the detail of the operation.
	--As discussed with the prior reviewer, we need all of the elements
	you would have us move in order to make our case(s). And we
	do not want to overwhelm the reader. Lastly, some kind of a 
	self-contained paper for Levo is highly desirable, and this is
	it.
	--No changes made.

END OF REVIEW


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our thanks to the reviewers for all of their helpful comments. Clearly, we
needed to clarify several things for Levo's operation to be more apparent.

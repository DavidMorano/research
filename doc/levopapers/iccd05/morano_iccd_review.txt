---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The wording "Unlike our work, all of these proposals have either not achieved
their performance objectives or..." does sound a bit self serving.

The first paragraph on page 2 (starting on page 1) is hard to understand,
because the authors presume that the reader is familiar with the content of
this paper.  The statements made need explanation as to how the issues are
resolved satisfactorily, or some of the points need to be deferred until later
in the paper. It is not clear how dependence check bveing spatially distributed
is accomplished, or how it helps at this point in the paper.
Likewise, how is the ROB eliminated?

The sentence "Forwarding of instruction execution results is done from
the issue station itself, rather from the FU (if one was used)." is (*) not
clear, and missing a THAN (rather THAN) or BUT (BUT rather).  Even with the
right word added, I could not visualize what this means, though.

"This arrangement allows for some simple instructions to be executed within the
issue without circulating through the function unit pipelines." -- within the
issue WHAT?  More generally though, if you are trying to state you can do
execution without a function unit/pipeline, the moment you are building logic
in the issue station, you have built an FU.  The one exception might be copy
ops, but if it is this what you mean, you should state so explicitly.

When are the registers read to obtain initial values. (i.e., if no updates are
in flight)?

Is there any preference given to older instructions to help forward progress on
instruction issue?  

Page 3 - functionalLY differentiated (missing LY).

In the center of "the figure" what figure? If you mean figure 1, say so. 

What do you mean by "statistically multiplexed". Also, you assert that "Note
that all of these buses are either point-to-point or multimaster buses,
but do not constitute a complex switching network as
used for example in the Ultrascalar design [5]." but offer no proof or even
argument to support this claim.

No space before a colon (:) in the typesetting for the English language.

It goes without saying that the fields of an instruction would be ISA specific.

The mention of time tag has me intrigued, esp. since you want to hold its size
to the number of issue stations.  Is there a 1:1 relationship? Do you compact
issue stations?  If so, do you relabel time tags?  If not, how do you deal with
wrap-around?  Does your comparison logic require extra inputs to handle this
(i.e., at least 2x tags compared to issue stations?)

You explain when a snarf occurs, not what it is. (Page 5)   I presume you mean
the act of revoking an operand?  Are there race conditions possibly, where an
operand is to be revoked, but the instruction ends up being committed before
the srevocation reaches this instruction?  How do you avoid this?  

There needs to be more analysis of the results, and explanation of how the
microarchitecture works.  Some of the questions in this review are questions
that come immediately to mind, but surely you will find many other things that
need to be explained, as you review this.

You will also want to add discussion of items like how often a typical
instruction gets executed before its value stabilizes, how to minimize this
number to reduce energy consumption and wasting issue slots, and so forth.

Finally, you are lacking a discussion of prior art.  This should include
typical replay architectures, such as the Alpha 264 described by Kessler, and
the BOA research prototype described in IEEE Computer 2000 and its very replay
oriented architecture described in IBM Research Report 23113.  Finally, in the
context of ILP extraction, the analysis of oracle ILP parallelism by Ebcioglu
(MICRO in Haifa) deserves mention as well.

Also, in typesetting English, punctuation is merged with the preceding word. 
In Reference [2], the . (dot) should not be in a line on its own, which it
would not be without the preceding spave
[3] misspells partitioning.  RAW should be written {RAW} in your bibtex so it
keeps capitalization.  Either write out the conference title as
in [5] or [6], or abbreviate as in [2], but please be consistent.

In summary, I would be extremely interested to see this paper appear, since it
contains several interesting ideas.  You should add more analysis of the
results, with additional data points giving you a chance to describe the dieas
and avantagees more.  You also need to work on making statements more explicit
rather than be presented by allusion and implication.  I hope this review does
not discourage you from resubmitting an updated version to a future conference,
such as HPCA or PACT, or next year's ICCD.

Overall Comments:

I've recommended that this paper be rejected, but I'd consider my 
rejection a weak rejection.  While I do not think the paper presents
a stunningly new idea, I think it has merit.  With revisions and some
clarifications, I think it could be a fine, if not ground-breaking,
paper.

My biggest concern about the paper is that there are portions that lack
clarity, making it difficult for the reader to fully understand the
approach.  With a little bit of effort, this can easily be rectified.
At a high level, my other large comment is that the authors do not
address the issue of power.  While I would not reject this paper because
it does not address power, I think it's a reasonable expectation for
that issue to be discussed in a paper that is resulting in 200% of the
committed instructions to be executed.              Below you'll find my detailed
comments which will hopefully help to improve the paper.

Detailed Comments:

You need to perform an editing pass on the paper. Most sections were
well-written, but a few need some help.  The results section
in particular needs some attention.  While I think Snarf was a good
name for the cat in the Thundercats cartoon, it is a bit too informal
for its use here.

I thought your introduction was a nicely crafted motivation for your work.

I have several comments about section 2.  First, it is unclear how
simple instructions execute in the issue station.  A specific example
might help clarify what you mean.  Second, I had trouble understanding
the criteria for instruction commit.  What does the phrase "are not in
the process of receiving updated inputs" mean?              Does it mean that all
previous instructions that produce a given instruction's operands have
already been committed?  If so, say that.  Similarly, I did not
understand the statement "finished forwarding output operands to
younger program-oriented instructions".  What does it mean to have
finished forwarding output operands?  Does it mean that the result has
been committed to the register file and all in-flight later
instructions have been updated?  Please clarify.

Continuing in section 2, Figure 1 should have been presented at the 
beginning of the section.  Your description of Figure 1 left me 
confused.  In particular, I do not know what a bus group is.  Are
the FUs in a bus group identical?  Approximately how many bus
groups would an execution window have?              How many issue stations?

My last comment for section 2 has to do with the vertical buses.  You 
comment that they are simple and scalable.  However, I think you 
need to somehow quantify the amount (or lack thereof) of bus
contention.  Buses often provoke knee jerk reactions of not being scalable.  
Given the frequency of re-execution and hence the resending of
operands, you need to address the impact of re-execution on bus
contention.

In section 3, there is some confusion over the use of the terms time
ordering tag and time tag.  You appear to use them interchangeably at
times.              Please choose one and stick to it.  The difference between the
instruction and operand time tags is unclear and you never discuss
how time tags are assigned for operands.  With respect to the time
ordering values for instructions, you say that instructions are 
ordered with respect to all instructions currently in the execution
window.  Does this mean that *all* instructions within the execution
window complete before any new instructions are added into the
execution window?  Otherwise, how do you not have wraparound issues
with the tags?              As a final note, you might want to explicitly 
discuss how this ordering based on tags prevents problems with 
different types of dependencies.

The relationship between figures 1 and 2 is a bit confusing because at
least one bus (FU result-return bus group) is vertical in one of the
figures and horizontal in the other figure.

In your discussion of fast-forwarding, I did not see a number
representing the number of instructions you fast-forwarded.  

Finally, I looked at Table 2 and could not see where 1.46% speedup
came from.  I believe it comes from dividing 1.61 by 1.1.  You really
should clarify where the number is coming from; otherwise, the reader
keeps looking in the table for the number 1.46.  Most readers do not
keep a calculator handy when reading and thus will be annoyed when
asked to actually perform calculations that the author could have
simply mentioned.

                          Detailed Comments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper proposes a microarchitecture based on re-execution of
dynamic instructions (without re-dispatch/re-fetch). The authors argue
that this approach reduces interconnect complexity, possibly allowing
more aggressive processor configurations. The results show a good
improvement over the baseline.

The biggest issue is that this paper does not do an adequate job
describing the proposed architecture. I had to reread Section 3
several times to understand what was going on. Examples would be
helpful. 

In addition, the complexity savings are not obvious, nor are they
sufficiently explained in the text. Section 1 makes reference to
the "complex associative searches of the ROB" being eliminated through
the introduction of this architecture, but I am not sure that the
seemingly huge buses (width includes instruction time, type, address,
values) used in this approach are any better. You need to provide a
better argument as to why the complexity is reduced. How would cycle
time be impacted?

Section 4 has to do a better job explaining where the performance
benefits come from because they are not from a single, obvious
cause. You should provide more detailed simulation data to give
credence to the results. Under what specific circumstances is
performance better than the baseline? How often do these situations
arise?

Finally, you should also address power. If you are executing around 2x
the number of committed instructions, it seems hard to imagine any
real energy-delay^2 improvement. Can you argue that your approach is
not power-inefficient.

                          Detailed Comments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think that the proposed idea is interesting and deserves further 
exploration. Unfortunately, there are several issues that need to 
be explained/resolved in detail before the paper can be accepted. 
Some of those are itemized below:

a) The authors should include a power/energy analysis. The
results presented in Table 2 indicate that the applications incur  
between 79% to 115% re-executions compared to the baseline case.
I do not think that those numbers indicate a power-efficient architecture.

b) 10 out of 12 Spec-int2000 benchmarks are shown, I would have liked 
to see the complete results. Moreover, for one benchmark there is an
IPC drop, the authors should discuss why this is the case.

c) I would have appreciated a rudimentary area analysis. Although the
ROB is eliminated, the area of the reservation stations are increased
through the addition of extra storage and control logic. With this 
analysis, the authors claim of decreased complexity would be 
strengthened.

d) All the instruction window is flushed on a branch misprediction in the
baseline architecture. Most state of the art processors employ either
checkpointing or ROB-walkback schemes to decrease this penalty; therefore
this should have been the baseline. I would have also liked a section on 
how to incorporate those schemes into the microarchitecture proposed
by the authors.

e) The authors should include a section on how exceptions are
handled in the absence of a ROB.

f) The authors should discuss additional relevant work. For example, 
many "replay" mechanisms require instructions to remain the the
issue slot after the instruction is speculatively issued to a 
functional unit. In this regard, this is very similar to what is
proposed in the paper. Another line of work that the authors may
want to refer is the use of counters and/or timestamping in the
issue queues; this is similar to the use of timestamps in the 
snooping mechanism.    

g) If my understanding is correct, some "simple" instructions, such 
as the control-flow and load-store instructions are not sent to the 
functional units but are instead executed in the issue stations. I do 
not think those instructions can be classified as "simple". The 
load-store instructions in particular require complex ALU's with 
shifters and full-width adders. For a more realistic implementation,
I would encourage the authors to include an experiment in which all 
instructions sent to the functional units.

h) Although there are no spelling mistakes, there are a number of
grammatical errors in the text.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

An alternative core microarchitecture is proposed in which control and data
dependence resolution takes place in a distributed manner within augmented
reservation stations (issue stations).        Issue stations capture input operands
and broadcast output operands on several common result buses.  Instructions
reside in issue stations until retirement where they may re-execute several
times on different inputs before retirement.

Although the idea presented is interesting, it suffers from several severe
problems in its current implementation.  Among these:

- It is assumed that each issue station can execute loads, stores, and
control-flow instructions.  This implies the replication of a significant
amount of hardware in each station including address computation and
connections to the branch prediction hardware.

- Each issue station must snoop eight operands at once, and due to the use of
architectural register tags (address field), many may match an input operand
with different time tags.  Thus, there is an implied (but not shown) cross
comparison within each issue station of register tags using the broadcast time
tags and the reservation station's own time tag.  This is equivalent to the
problem of finding the youngest older store for store-load forwarding within an
LSQ, and it is not cheap to do.  Here it must be done within each issue station
across all possible buses from which an input operand may arrive.

- The wiring and area overhead of the issue stations makes it hard to imagine
that a 128+ drop multi-master bus will be operate in a single cycle as
simulated.  A discussion of this specific issue is explicitly omitted at the
end of section 2.  Given the massive amount of logic in each issue station
(prior two points), these buses will be significantly longer than in an
equivalently-sized standard issue window or reorder buffer.

- The power implications of this uarch, even in the abstract qualitative sense
is not addressed (this is also true of the area).  I have no reason to believe
that this uarch will be power efficient, especially given that approximately 2x
executions occur on average over a traditional core.

It may be that further study shows this microarchitecture to have promise, but
it is very premature as presented.

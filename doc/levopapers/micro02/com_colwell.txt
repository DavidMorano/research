Speaking of which, we know that the "compress" results in Fig. 9
have problems, and we are working to fix them.
If at all possible, please get back to us by this Friday, June 7. The
MICRO deadline is June 17th.


Gus: Are you sure you want to be in Istanbul this year? :-)

abstract: after stumbling over this, I think I'd prefer "The...buses
are segmented; their lengths are constant, that is, do not increase
with machine size." But I think it's a matter of taste, unless one has
a PhD in English.

section 1: "We have a great opportunity: in a few years, billion
transistor chips will be available." Implying what? That Levo is
unrealizable in fewer transistors than that?  Or that its performance
advantages only show up beyond a certain transistor count?  Judging
from the next paragraph, you mean Levo needs lots of transistors or it
isn't worth doing. Ok, as far as it goes. But blowing off the power
constraint issue doesn't feel all that compelling to me. Chips are
already power constrained at the 100M transistor level; you're planning
to grow that by an order of magnitude without grappling with its
implications? Hmmm... Well, as a technical reader, I would still want
to read your paper to see if I think the structures and evidence you
present lead to promising performance results, but you sure have stuck
a big caveat in my mind at the outset. Instead of "Power and energy
consumption are also issues, but...  are not covered in depth herein"
I'd suggest something more like "Modern microprocessors such as Intel's
Itanium Processor Family are already power-constrained at the 100M
transistor level, so extrapolating into a 1B transistor design realm
clearly implies serious power challenges. But before we consider what
any given microarchitecture can or should do about its power
dissipation, we believe its performance potential should be clearly
established. That is the focus of this paper."

Gotta tell you, I smiled when I saw this phrase: "In typical
microprocessors, such as the Pentium P6 microarchitecture and the Alpha
EV8..." Let's see, one of those has sold over 1B chips, and the
other...zero, design never completed. It also tickles me to see P6
referred to as "typical". A lot has changed in 10 years.  :-)

More seriously, I think you're right about scalability of Reorder
buffers, RS's, and so on. But you do not mention pipeline depth?
Surprising, because that depth sets the direction of a lot of the rest
of the uArch. Some good, some bad.  Deeper pipes, to a point, will get
you around a lot of the objections you raise here, but come with their
own baggage of course. On the other hand, deeper pipes also can give
you higher clocks, which the buying public currently seems to like.

"In Levo any instruction set can be used, and no compiler modifications
are necessary..." Well, either you're saying you can implement a Turing
machine, in which case this sentence is vacuous, or you're making a
claim that is so bold as to border on magic. For example, a statically
scheduled ISA like IA-64 would seem to prefer a microarchitecture that
would differ substantially from the OOO behemoths of the IA32 side. Are
you saying Levo can support any ISA *equally well*, or are you making a
smaller claim that Levo is unusually good at supporting varying ISAs,
but not all to the same degree? Tell you what -- I think your paper
would be stronger if you make only the bold claims you must, but no
others. Instead of "In Levo any ISA...", why not something more like
"Our intention is to develop Levo as a general purpose uArch, capable
of high performance under any ISA. To date our experience has been very
encouraging, and we will return to this aspect of Levo in future work,
including prospects for Levo-specific compiler optimizations."

I wish Figure 1 had a paragraph devoted to a simple description of
basically how this thing works. I suspect the 1st paragraph in section
3 was intended as that, but for me, at least, it's extremely difficult
to remember all the new jargon you had to invent for Levo, and then
intuit how these new things all work together.  I want a paragraph that
describes Figure 1, not in Levo jargon, but in words that a Micro
attendee would understand even if he or she had never heard of Levo or
DEE in their lives. Alternatively, you might add a sequence of figures
to walk a single instr through the various stages. The problem overall
is that if you lose the reader here, they will quit reading.

I'm slow. I have now read and reread the paragraph on how the
time-tagging works, and I just do not get it. In Figure 2, I assume that
an OOO machine can have instrs 1, 5, and 9 execute in any order
whatsoever. So all three are sitting in some temp structure with
Levo-invented names (:-)) and instr 1 executes. Does instr 9 grab instr
1's results or not? How does instr 9 know whether there are any
intervening instrs that also write register 4? The text in the
paragraph seem to imply that "the snarfing instruction will execute";
this tells me that instr 9 must NOT have snarfed instr 1's result. But
darned if I can see how the time-tagging accomplished that.

By the way, we used time-tagging all over the place in both P6 and
Pentium 4. Each instr is assigned a time tag at decode time; these tags
are what determine things like which stores must execute before which
loads, the instr retirement order, and so on. But there may be subtle
differences between tags that are truly related to absolute time, and
those which merely serve to indicate relative time, such as instruction
ordering. Does Levo use the absolute or relative flavor of "time-tag"?

section 3.2: I can't quite picture what it means for RFU's to be
"globally inconsistent but locally accurate." Does the traffic across
these RFU's get time-tagged, and that info is what is used to reimpose
global consistency later?

Figure 4 raises a question. I can see why you claim the "from previous
column" and "to next column" interconnects are reasonably scalable. But
do the first and last columns have to connect, to make a circular
structure overall? How long do THOSE buses get? I claim it's those
lengths that will restrict you, not the column i to column i+1
interconnects.

I liked figure 5. HAd to study it for about 20 minutes but I think I
see where you're going with the HW pred.

Table 1...main memory latency 100 cycles? Seems awfully short, it's 100
cycles right now in Pentium 4 systems. Why not something more like the
800 cycles you mentioned earlier in the paper?

section 7: I do not recognize the reference to a "PISA" machine model.
Need a ref.

section 7.2: usually if an incremental change to a machine design
decision yields a big perf delta, it means the machine is currently
hamstrung per that design decision.  If you then change some OTHER
design decision, and it ALSO yields a big perf delta, that's kinda
weird. Why didn't the first bottleneck choke the 2nd design decision,
before AND after? Makes me somewhat suspicious of the performance
analysis or methodology...

Figure 8 is too small to read, as is. Can't you combine these somehow
into one or two much larger graphs?

The summary in section 8 is, er, uh, uninspiring. Here you have one of
the most interesting, original designs aimed at profitably using 1B
transistors, and you have a bunch of interesting performance data from
simulations of same, and it all still looks very promising. I think you
can make a stronger claim here, and remind the reader of the bigger
context. Something like "1B-transistor CPU designs must satisfy
multiple hard constraints, including very long memory latency, need for
fast clock rates, and execution of legacy von Neumann-style code, while
carefully observing the requirements of the VLSI implementation
technology, such as scalable structures and short buses. This paper has
proposed Levo, a microarch specifically aimed at satisfying all of
those constraints. We have presented very encouraging performance
simulation results, and we are actively pursuing follow-on work
in...blah blah blah."

My main message back to you is this. I hope Micro accepts your paper,
mostly because a) most of Micro is devoted to squeezing N% out of
existing microarchitectures, where N is a small number, and b) the rest
are scattered among many other topics, almost never including "what the
heck are we going to do with 1B transistors".  Especially not when the
answer includes concessions to issues of chip layout, bus design, clock
ramifications, and so on, as your paper does. I think you want to make
sure the reader understands that useful research on machine design for
the 1B transistor realm absolutely requires that ALL constraints be
observed; the usual Micro conf trick of ignoring anything that's
awkward or hard must not be encouraged this far out in time. The paper
does a decent job of setting that context up in the beginning, but it
doesn't return to that theme at the end, and I really think that's one
of the strongest parts of what you're doing.  Everyone else is tweaking
furiously; you are rethinking whole areas of machine design. Make sure
they see that.

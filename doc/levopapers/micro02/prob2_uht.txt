I do not follow you. This is a general problem. It may take the M-path one
cycel to be in column 0, or it may be there already. Then what?

What horizontal buses? There are none. There are just connections between
forwarding units. Even if there were horizontal buses, it could take
multiple cycles for the data to propagate down them.

see above.

I thought D-paths could be assigned at random, from anywhere in the 
E-window, since they could be free anywhere in the E-window.

Same thing.

No, it isn't, 'cause we still have the D-path state ready. If the D-path
is normally way ahead of the M-path, as you say above, then there's no
problem in reloading the M-path instructions in new columns. (This
is available within one cycle, and can be broadside loaded from the
I-fetch/I-cache copy in the center channel of the floorplan.)

What if the D-path hasn't computed them yet?

As we've discussed, the forwarding unit
delay should be much less than the backwarding/forwarding bus delay, so do
it all in 1 cycle. What are you doing now? When you say "horizontal buses",
do you mean one bus per AS row, or what?

Let's say 6 PM, to end by 7 PM. I'll call you, as you desire.
Dave, you can call me, as usual. Let me know if there's any problem with
this time.

Which reminds me, do we have the date yet characterizing the performance
effects of decreased/increased Forwarding Unit delays?

Talk to you later.

Subject: DEE and Levo, with current floorplan

Hi Ali and Dave,
	First, please do not respond to this email with "I think...", I need
"I know..."'s. And if you do not know, please find out. Time is short, as
you know.

	I have been thinking about DEE operation and Levo, particularly
in view of the current floorplan, which does not have "long line" 
broadcast buses. I know we discussed some of this at an in-person meeting
a while ago, but I do not feel satisfied issues have been adequately
addressed.
	In the following, unless stated otherwise, all columns are logical,
it is assumed that column
m-1 wraps around to 0 with one cycle delay. D-paths
are 1-column long.

	First, you've been telling us that the M-path state 
logically after a D-path is retained upon the D-path being taken, with the
D-path results being re-broadcast from its forwarding units. That sounds
fine, performance-wise, but I have no idea how to realize it, given the
current floorplan, without a penalty > 1 cycle. Specifically:

1. If M-path column 2 has a spawned D-path in column 5, does it take
5-1 = 4 cycles (one cycle per column) for results from M-path 1 to get to
the D-path? Is this modeled in FastLevo? Is it an issue?

2. With the same assumptions as in 1., say the D-path branch is
mispredicted, so the D-path is used. Then the D-path in column 5 becomes
M-path 2; how do results get from the new M-path column 2 to M-path columns
3 and 4? 

3. What about the converse? M-path in column 5, D-path in column 2,
misprediction, M-path column 5 is now in column 2, with M-paths 3 and 4 
after it; M-path column 6 is 3 columns from column 5; does this imply
a 3-cycle delay? Is this modelled in FastLevo? Is it an issue?

4. In the current version of FastLevo, what is the M-path to D-path
switch penalty? Is this overlapped with execution, or does the whole
E-window stall? Is it overlapped with the re-broadcast of D-path results?

5. Not to mention commit issues....


With the above, I can see how the time tags can keep everything functionally
correct, but the performance effects of switching from one path to another
appear messy, at best.

Have we ever run experiments assuming the much simpler model of throwing
all M-path state logically after the D-path state out? But even this seems
problematic, given case 3. above.

It seems to me we still have to move the D-path contents to the 
mispredicting branch's M-path, in order for everything to work out and be
clean. Now, we do not have to move the instructions, they're the same.
We do not really need to move the source operands. We do need to move the
actual predicate state and instruction operation results, if any exist.
We need to move the state (executed or not, etc.) of the instructions.
We can add logic so that if the result is recomputed, but doesn't change,
nothing is broadcast.

So the questions are, how best to do this in a real Levo with the 
current floorplan, first, and second, can this be simply modelled in
FastLevo (maybe with just a conservative DEE penalty) in time for 
MICRO?

I would suggest that (part of) a solution may be to use the re-broadcast
of the D-path results to get these results over to their new locations,
as well as causing subsequent M-path instructions to snarf, appropriately.
One way of cutting down the overall delay for this is to use both
forwarding AND backwarding buses from the D-path Forwarding Units. If the
D-path is relabelled as the corresponding M-path before the broadcast,
the time tags should make everything come out right. Paths would also have
to be able to snoop and snarf from backwarding buses.

If the bus traffic can be modeled, then we're OK. The DEE penalty could 
actually be negative, since results could arrive earlier than before.

We may have to have a conference call on this tomorrow sometime.

Note that what we need at a minimum here is a) to have an actual Levo
solution for the problem, but b) to contain it, conservatively, 
(but at least close to the real value so we do not penalize ourselves 
too much) from
a performance modelling point of view in FastLevo, at least for the
purposes of the MICRO paper.

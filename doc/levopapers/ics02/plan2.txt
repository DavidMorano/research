Ali,

Here are two possible hypothesis for the paper :

1) multipath execution hides misprediction penalties for
   hard-to-predicate condition branches (same as was used in ICS paper)

2) larger sized machines produce higher IPC numbers (?)

Do you have any others ?


Here is a first draft at a simulation plan :

Background info.
Memory configurations :

	config (similar to Skipper paper) #1

	- 64KB L1 I, 2-wat set associative, 2 clock hit delay
	- 64KB L1 D, 2-wat set associative, 2 clock hit delay
	- unified I&D L2, 2MB direct mapped, 12 clock hit delay
	- main memory, 100 access delay
	- all memory 4-way interleaved

	config (worse) #2

	- 64KB L1 I, 2-wat set associative, 4 clock hit delay
	- 64KB L1 D, 2-wat set associative, 4 clock hit delay
	- unified I&D L2, 2MB direct mapped, 20 clock hit delay
	- main memory, 800 access delay
	- all memory 4-way interleaved

	config (more like real life) #3

	- 64KB L1 I, 2-wat set associative, 2 clock hit delay
	- 64KB L1 D, 2-wat set associative, 2 clock hit delay
	- unified I&D L2, 4MB direct mapped, 16 clock hit delay
	- main memory, 1000 access delay
	- all memory 16-way interleaved


Machine size numbers are in x-y-z where
x	SG rows
y	AS rows per SG
z	SG columns



+ sim. set 1
(general machine performance versus machine size)

Do all machine configurations
[4,8,16,32]-[2,4,8]-[8,16,32]

with memory config # 1 above.  
( 4 x 3 x 3 = 36 combinarions here)


+ sim. set 2
(memory delay variation study)

Do machine sizes [16,32]-[4,8]-[8] with all three memory configs above.

(2 x 2 x 1 x 3 = 12 combinations)


+ sim set #3

Do machine combination 8-8-8 with 

	- number of DEE paths of 0,2,4,8
	and
	- starting DEE path spawned in columns 0,1,2

(1 x 4 x 3 = 12 combinations here)


Other notes :

+ DEE path size

	we do not have it so we skip it !  (Is this correct ?)


+ DEE path "release"

	we do not have it yet so we skip it !  (Is this correct ?)



Total simulations for starters so far :
	set #1		36 combinations
	set #2		12 combinations
	set #3		12 combinations
	---------------------------------
	total		60 combinations

	x 5 benchmarks	300


At 7 hours per run, and assumming we can start these like Saturday
night some time, we should have about 80 hours of run-time.
We have 28 CPUs at URI and about 8 (equivalent) at NU for
a total of about 36 CPUs or  36 x 72 = 2592 equivalent CPU-hours.

2592 / 7 hours per run = 370 total runs available before Wednesday
morning (deadline was assumed to be mid-night Tuesday night).

With 300 sims and 370 runs available, we should have almost
everything in by Tuesday night.

Comments ?
Please provide suggestions on either sims that you think
we need or on ones listed above that you do not think we need.
This is just a rough guess at this point as should be fairly obvious ! :-)

Will we have that "DEE release" feature at some point ?

Thanks,
Dave M.

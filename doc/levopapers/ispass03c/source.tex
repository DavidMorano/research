\begin{abstract}
%
We explore various intervals between memory loads and stores.
Distributions of three different types of access intervals
are defined and data is gathered on them using benchmarks.
The data on there access intervals serve to provide insight
about how a suitable microarchitecture might take advantage
of the memory access behavior in order to reduce the overhead
of general memory access transactions.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{-0.15in}
%
This paper present data to characterize three types of
memory access intervals defined in terms of dynamic memory
instructions separating memory accesses.

\section{Register Access Statistics}
\vspace{-0.15in}
%
In this section, we show the register access statistics for
each of out ten benchmark programs.
The data is presented in three sets.
The first set of data is for register access-use intervals.
The second set of data is for register useful-lifetimes, and
the third is for register def-use intervals.

Data set one is shown in Figures \ref{fig:bzip2_rrint} 
through \ref{fig:craft_rrint}.

\section{Memory Access Statistics}
\vspace{-0.15in}
%
In this section, we show memory statistics for
the memory useful-lifetimes as well as for the def-use intervals.
Following are graphs of the cumulative data for :

\begin{enumerate}
\item One option is to dynamically follow
each output path and assign successively higher time tag values
to succeeding instructions.
\vspace{-0.15in}
\item The second option is to try to determine if the \textit{taken} outcome
of the branch joins with the \textit{not-taken} output instruction
stream.  If a join is determined, the instruction following
the \textit{not-taken} output path can be assigned a time value
one higher than the branch itself, while the first instruction
on the \textit{taken} path would be assigned whatever value
it would have gotten counting up from the first instruction
on the \textit{not-taken} path.
\end{enumerate}

Both a density and a distribution over the
associated intervals is shown.
The data is cumulative over all programs and memory variables
of each program.

Figures \_MRINTDEN and \_MRINTDIS show the density and distribution
respectively for the memory reads over instruction intervals.
An access is defined as either a read or a write.
So an access-usage interval is the interval in instructions
from either a read or a write to the next read of the same
variable.  
There an instance of an access-usage for each memory
read in the executed program.

Figures \_MLIFEDEN and \_MLIFEDIS show the density and distribution
respectively for the memory writes over the useful-lifetime interval
as measured in instructions.
Our definition of \fIUseful-lifetime\fP 
(which is the same as that by Franklin and Sohi)
is the interval in dynamic instructions from a write of a variable
to the last useful read of the same variable.
There is an instance of a useful-lifetime associated with
each write of the executed programs.  However, it should be noted
that the present data does not include the last write for which
the last useful read has not yet been determined. 
This would seem to be more appropriate than assuming that the
last executed read of a variable was indeed the same useful read (since
it is unknown whether there are further reads afterwards).
